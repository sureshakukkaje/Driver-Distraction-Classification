# Driver-Distraction-Classification
Driver Distraction Classification using CNN, Vanilla Model and VGG Pretrained model 


Driver Distraction Monitoring This notebook is for the classification of driver behavior. We will do image pre-processing and use Deep learning CNN for identifying the behavior of the driver. Which is necessary for handling the unexpected road accident.

Nowadays vehicles are increasing exponentially. We need to be extra careful about the road incident. As there are a couple of things around you, which can distract the driving. We can use this model and implement a smart system, which will monitor driver activities at the time of driving and can alert him about the activities. It will reduce the number of roads accidents and will increase road safety.

State Farm Distracted Driver Detection has divided driving behavior into 10 classes. CLASS Description

C2 Talking On The Phone - Right

C3 Texting- left

C4 Talking on the Phone- left

C5 Operating The Radio

C6 Drinking

C7 Reaching Behind

C8 Hair And Makeup

C9 Talking To Passenger

We will implement a deep learning model, which will predict the driver activities at the time of driving.
